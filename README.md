## üí° How It Works

This application retrieves your transaction data directly from Etherscan-compatible blockchain APIs. It intelligently identifies transactions involving known Lanca Dex router contracts and calculates their value in USD using a set of pre-defined, average token prices.

**_Important Note:_** _The token prices utilized for volume calculation are based on periodically updated averages and are **not real-time live prices**. Therefore, the displayed USD volume should be considered an approximation for historical tracking._
